""" 1. Nested Decisions: The Adventure Game üè∞
Objective: To practice the use of nested if statements.

Task 1: Code Correction You are provided with a Python script 
that is supposed to guide a user through an adventure game, 
but it has some errors. Identify and fix them.

Task 2: Setting the Scene
Based on your corrected code from Task 1, expand the game.
 If the user chooses "cave", ask them if they want to "light a torch" or 
 "proceed in the dark", and provide outcomes for each decision.

Task 3: Default Path
If the user makes an invalid choice at any point, 
incorporate a pass statement to handle it. 
**HINT: How can an else statement be of use here?
